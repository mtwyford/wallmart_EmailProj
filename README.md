THis was a project from 2005
working for wal-mart
we had little/weak data connections to the store for ops training 
(long story)

instead, SM  (Store managers) would be sent an email and asked to reply inline to the email
when the emails came back, we'd process them as individual files, or in this case, 
copy and past the body of an email into one cell and then run the macro to strip out relevant data from the email
and parse into an adjacent sheet (keeping track of #non-empty rows, etc

then, we gave back to the eval team to read the survey... (tough job..oooh)
